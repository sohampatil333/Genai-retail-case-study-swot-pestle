# Retail Strategy Case Study — GenAI + SWOT/PESTLE

An end-to-end, prompt-driven strategic analysis of a retail company using **Generative AI** and **SWOT/PESTLE** to turn qualitative environmental observations into **high-impact recommendations**.

> Core idea: External macro headwinds + internal legacy tech created a “two-front war.” We used structured prompts to extract signals, synthesize insights, and prioritize action. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## 🧭 Problem Statement

The company is struggling to adapt: **legacy systems** slow down AI/cloud/mobile-first ambitions while **macroeconomic pressure** and **price wars** erode margins. Goal: produce **actionable, prioritised recommendations** that balance internal fixes with external positioning. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Frame the case**  
   - Define hypotheses and key questions (profitability squeeze, technical debt, market niches). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

2. **Prompt-driven signal extraction**  
   - Map qualitative entries into themes: Market, Competitor, Tech, Legal, Social, Economic, etc.  
   - Identify noise (e.g., unusable “Voice of Customer” column). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

3. **SWOT construction**  
   - **S:** AI/Cloud/Mobile-first, cybersecurity; **W:** legacy systems, VOC gap  
   - **O:** health & sustainability niches, competitor exits; **T:** inflation, price wars, regulatory burden :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

4. **PESTLE analysis**  
   - Economic (inflation/unemployment), Legal (privacy/IP), Social (sustainability/health), Tech (migration), etc. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

5. **Synthesis & Prioritization**  
   - Convert insights to **High-Impact Recommendations** and risk-mitigation steps. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## ✅ Key Insights

- **Technical-Debt Anchor:** Legacy systems neutralize AI/cloud strengths → fix first. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- **Macro Squeeze:** Inflation + saturated markets + price cuts = race to the bottom. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **VOC Blind Spot:** Customer-feedback pipeline broken → implement multi-channel VOC. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **Pivot to Niches:** Target **health/sustainability** segments to escape price wars. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

---

## 📌 High-Impact Recommendations

- **Tech:** Fast-track legacy decommissioning → unified cloud platform  
- **Product:** Launch premium **sustainability/health** brand line  
- **Marketing:** Lead with **data-trust & cybersecurity** as a differentiator  
- **Ops:** Use AI for demand forecasting & supply risk mitigation  
- **Insights:** Stand up a robust **Voice of Customer** system immediately :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

## 🧪 Reproducibility (How to Use Prompts)

1. **Framing Prompt**  
   - “You are a strategy analyst. Given qualitative retail environment observations, identify the internal vs external conflict and articulate 3–5 hypotheses worth testing.”

2. **Signal Extraction Prompt**  
   - “Classify entries into {Market, Competitor, Tech, Legal, Social, Economic, Environmental}. Summarize dominant patterns and outliers.”

3. **SWOT Prompt**  
   - “From the classified signals, derive a balanced SWOT with 3–5 points per quadrant. Keep internal vs external strictly separated.”

4. **PESTLE Prompt**  
   - “Map external signals to PESTLE with 2–3 bullets per factor including risk/opportunity and likely impact channel.”

5. **Decision Synthesis Prompt**  
   - “Translate SWOT/PESTLE into 5 high-impact recommendations with ‘why it matters’, first steps, and expected effect.”
